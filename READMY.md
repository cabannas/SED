# Moisterino - Automated Irrigation System

## Description
"Moisterino" is a automated irrigation system designed as a project for the Distributed Embedded Systems course within the Master's program in Computer Engineering at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. It harnesses the capabilities of Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and two Arduino Uno R3 microcontrollers, interfacing with moisture sensors and water pumps to create a self-regulating ecosystem for plant care.

### Requisites
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- Arduino Uno R3 microcontrollers (x2)
- Moisture sensors compatible with Arduino
- Water pumps
- Cables, breadboard, and other electronic components for connections
- Development environment for Raspberry Pi and Arduino

## Development
The "Moisterino" project is a culmination of efforts in the "Distributed Embedded Systems" course of the Master's program in Computer Engineering at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM). Developed in 2023, the system was designed and built by Daniel Cabanas and Hanjie Zhu who aimed to simplify plant irrigation through smart technology. Using the Raspberry Pi 3B as a central controller and Arduino Uno R3 boards for interfacing with the physical world, Moisterino provides a seamless and efficient solution to maintaining optimal soil moisture levels.
